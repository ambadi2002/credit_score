## ⚙️ Model Sample Inputs
The application takes the following inputs to predict the credit score:
- **Age**: 23
- **Monthly In-hand Salary**: 1824.843
- **Interest Rate**: 3%
- **Delay From Due Date**: 3 days
- **Number Of Delayed Payments**: 7
- **Credit Utilization Ratio**: 26.82%
- **Credit History Age**: 265 months
- **Payment Behavior**: 2 (Categorical variable)
- **Monthly Balance**: 312.4941
- **Credit Age in Years**: 22.08 years

## 📊 Results
The model categorizes the creditworthiness of a customer based on the provided inputs, assigning them into one of the three categories: **Good**, **Standard**, or **Poor**.
